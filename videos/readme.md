### They took my baby from me

```
"I loved her so much, I still love her. I'm her mum."

Hundreds of women in the UK, forced into giving up their babies for adoption in the 1950s, 60s and 70s, have called on the prime minister to issue a government apology.

Up to 250,000 women in Britain were coerced into handing over their babies because they were unmarried.

Many of the women never had more children and say the loss caused them to lead a lifetime of grief.
